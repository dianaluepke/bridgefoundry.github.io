title: Bridge Foundry Finance Manager
---

Bridge Foundry, Inc. is seeking a Finance Manager (part-time contract). This position is a great opportunity to help shape the success of a growing nonprofit organization that is helping to increase diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.

Timely follow through on communication with volunteers about day-to-day finance tasks is the most important responsibility for this role, as many of Bridge Foundry’s core services to volunteers are finance related: reimbursements, funds transfers, grant applications, and so on.

Bridge Foundry operates without a physical office and you will be able to perform the work in any location that has internet access. You can set your own schedule as long as time sensitive work is completed when needed and you are able to negotiate times to meet with staff and volunteers via video conference, which may require some evening and/or weekend availability.
