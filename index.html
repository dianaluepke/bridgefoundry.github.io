We are dedicated to doing whatever it takes so that the makers of technology are reflective of our society, because diversity fosters innovation.</p><p>  We offer free, open source materials and online resources. Even expert volunteers learn by teaching.

          <p>Hundreds of workshops in dozens of cities around the world have been organized and taught by volunteers, based on our open source curricula and teaching techniques.</p>

          <p>Volunteers can self-organize using open source materials and free online resources. This distributed, viral teaching model has unparalleled potential for growth. </p>

          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers who 
            can act independently to create positive change in their communities. 
            Our free workshops typically have waitlists, so we encourage anyone 
            to replicate the events.</p>
            
            <p>There's no need to ask permission if someone wants to create an 
              event to teach other people technical skills. We ask only that
              you offer the event at no cost to students, follow our <a href="https://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>, and do outreach to underserved individuals.  Please 
              use our <a href="http://bridgetroll.org">online registration website</a> which will ensure that all 
              participants review the code of conduct before signing up.</p>
              
            <p>Volunteers have the freedom to act independently, but we are 
              stronger together and we want to help.  We have curricula for many
              different technologies and a network of volunteers who will mentor 
              new organizers or volunteer to teach at your event.</p>

          <p>We think of new initiatives and events like the old folktale about <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2009/10/stone-soup-workshop/">stone soup</a>.  
            A brave and passionate volunteer wants to make their community more
            inclusive and welcoming or build a new community that will help them 
            learn a new skill and we help find others who will make that happen 
            or simply provide information about what has worked before and cheer 
            them on!</p>

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>Most volunteer activities are focused on coding and leveling up in tech, and there is plenty of high impact work for people with a wide range
          of skills and interests. We need more folks willing to write words, 
          create images, conduct research, and develop materials about effective 
          teaching and positive conflict resolution. Of course, there are opportunities to write code too.</p>
