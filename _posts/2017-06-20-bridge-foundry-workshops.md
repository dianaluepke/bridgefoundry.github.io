title: Community Initiatives All Over the World
---

Bridge Foundry volunteers share skills by creating open source curriculum, 
at free teaching events and in online mcommunities. Through teaching and 
organizing, we learn to be leaders, as well as levelling up our own tech skills.
Most workshops are organized by independent communities, sometimes by one
individual who has been to a workshop at a conference and then decided to 
create a community where they live.  

From its beginnings as RailsBridge, we have grown to include 8 Bridges, which 
now include ClojureBridge, MobileBridge, GoBridge, ElmBridge, ElixirBridge, 
ScalaBridge, and RustBridge. 

Each bridge focuses on different technologies. Every event connects working 
software developers and community or industry leaders to people 
in our communities who are underserved intech, which is actually a majority of 
the people in our society.  

Every event is organized by volunteers with teachers and TAs who range 
from industry experts to people who know just a little bit more than the 
students.  With technology always changing both teachers and students learn 
together.
